description: Core system characteristics that establish the foundation for risk assessment. These facts determine which specialized domain questions will be activated.
questions:
  - id: affects_production
    text: Does the solution affect production operations (availability/throughput/quality)?
    description: "True if it can stop, slow, or degrade production, quality, or safety. Includes read paths that operators depend on to run." 
    type: bool

  - id: external_access
    text: Is any user or system access from outside the enterprise trusted network required?
    description: "True if any access comes from the internet, partner networks, BYOD, unmanaged devices, or other non-trusted networks." 
    type: bool

  - id: uses_ai
    text: Does the solution use ML/AI for inference, classification, prediction, or decision support?
    description: "Include LLM/RAG, ML models, or analytics models that influence decisions. Exclude simple rules/thresholds." 
    type: bool

  - id: handles_sensitive_data
    text: Does the solution handle sensitive data (personal, confidential, regulated, trade secrets)?
    description: "True if it stores, processes, or transmits data that would cause harm if leaked/altered. Includes personal data and confidential manufacturing data." 
    type: bool

  - id: integration_present
    text: Does the solution integrate with other systems via APIs/events/files/commands?
    description: "True if it exchanges data with other systems (even one-way). Include manual file drops, API calls, event streams, and command channels." 
    type: bool

  - id: availability_critical
    text: Is the solution availability critical (e.g., 24/7, tight SLAs, production stop impact)?
    description: "True if downtime causes immediate or high-impact disruption (production stop, safety risk, major business impact), or requires HA/fast recovery." 
    type: bool

  - id: cost_commitment_level
    text: What is the economic commitment level (initial+run)?
    description: "Rough sizing only. Use 'high' when the solution has meaningful ongoing spend or long-term commitments that warrant cost guardrails." 
    type: enum
    allowed: [low, medium, high]
