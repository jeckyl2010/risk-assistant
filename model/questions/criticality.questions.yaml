scope: criticality
description: Determines manufacturing impact classification and production dependencies. Establishes isolation requirements, availability expectations, and operational resilience controls for production-critical systems.
questions:
  - id: criticality_level
    text: What is the manufacturing criticality level for this system?
    description: "Classify by impact (safety, production continuity, quality/compliance, financial). If unsure, assume higher criticality and document evidence to downgrade."
    type: enum
    allowed: [C0, C1, C2, C3, C4]

  - id: hard_wan_cloud_dependency
    text: Would loss of WAN/cloud connectivity stop or materially constrain production?
    description: "If WAN/cloud outage would stop production or make it unsafe to continue, answer true. Default stance: production-critical functions must not hard-depend on WAN/cloud."
    type: bool
